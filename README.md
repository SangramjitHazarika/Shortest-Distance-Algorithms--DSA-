# Shortest Distance Algorithms (DSA)
 
Front-end: - HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, AJAX Back-end: - PHP ( for writing Shortest Distance Algorithms)

This project is a web based application

Shortest Distance Algorithmic Solver consists of 3 famous algorithms - Floydd Warshal, Bellman Ford and A* Search Algorithms. For each and every algorithm we have some 2-3 solved examples step by step so that any once could understand. After grabbing the inner concepts of all these three algorithms, the user can take up his own example and can try to find the shortest path will all three algorithms. So along with the app the user also has the feasibility to try with his/her example. We have tried to show the inner concepts of all three algorithms with small-small anecdotes so the users can easily understand the concepts.
